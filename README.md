# Naive-Bees-Image-Loading-and-Processing
In this Project I used Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data. I created common transforms of images and created them in a pipeline.
This project is the first in a series of projects that move forward by working with image data, creating classifiers using traditional techniques, 
and harnessing the power of deep learning for computer vision. The second project in the series is Naive Bees: Predict Species from Images.
